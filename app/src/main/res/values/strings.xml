    <string name="bio"> Hi, I am the Android Phrophet,
    \n\nI am an android developer.
        \n\n I am also a virtual reality developer.
        \n as well as an augmented reality developer.
        \n\n I have a laptop, her name is Amanda.
        \n I am constantly learning technology.
        \n\n I work with Android Studio, Unity3d and Spark Ar.
        \n and of all three android studio is the most demanding.
        \n because android software,libraries, and method of coding keeps changing before you even blink.
        \n\n There is constantly so much to learn.
        \n I am currently looking for a job.
        \n Scary part is before you even finish learning it, it might become obsolete.
        \n\n i really enjoy working with unity and google cardboard sdk to build virtual reality apps.
        \n I have a VR app about space and the planets, its called planets at your feet.
        \n I have an instiable quest for knownledge, i like to know things.
        \n\n lately i have been obsessed with time.
        \n what is time?
        \n are we ever going to be able to manipulate and bend it to our will?
        \n what exists outside of time?
